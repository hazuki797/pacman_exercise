# pacman_exercise
This project showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic experience for the user. The importance of this project is that the pacman A) knows the boundaries of the webpage B) changes directions once it hits the end of the page. 

<h2>How to run:</h2> 
Open the webpage and you will automatically see a pac-man image traveling across your screen. Once it hits the end of the page, it will change directions to make its way back. 

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
Potential future improvements include more complex design having pac-mans in different colors and adding on multiple pacmans moving in random directions onto the screen in a click of a button. The ultimate goal will be to simulate the real pac-man game where the pac-man will be eating off ghosts.
