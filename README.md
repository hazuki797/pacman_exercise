This project represents a prime example of the seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, resulting in a dynamic and interactive user experience. The project amalgamates two mini-projects that were developed during the acquisition of skills related to interpreting JavaScript code in HTML pages and utilizing JavaScript to present data dynamically on a webpage.

The first part of the project showcases a Big Pac-man, which exhibits acute awareness of the webpage's boundaries and autonomously alters its direction of movement when it reaches the extremities of the page. The second part comprises mini Pac-mans that appears when the "Add PacMan" button is pressed, and commence moving when the "Start Game" button is clicked. The programming of this feature ensures that a random image from the four available Pac-man image variations is selected, and appears in a randomized location on the webpage upon adding a Pac-man. The mini Pac-man subsequently initiates random movements upon commencing the game.

<h2>How to run:</h2> 
Open the webpage and you will automatically see a big pac-man image traveling across your screen. Once it hits the end of the page, it will change directions to make its way back. You can add mini pac-man to the page by pressing "Add PacMan." You can press the button as many times as you like to add more pac-man to the page. The pac-man you added will all start moving at random around when you press "Start Game." 

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
Potential future improvements include more complex design having pac-mans in different colors and adding on multiple pacmans moving in random directions onto the screen in a click of a button. The ultimate goal will be to simulate the real pac-man game where the pac-man will be eating off ghosts.
