# pacman_exercise
This project exemplifies the seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce a dynamic and interactive user experience. The significance of this undertaking lies in the fact that the Pac-Man character not only possesses an acute awareness of the boundaries of the webpage but also autonomously alters its direction of movement upon reaching the extremities of the page.

<h2>How to run:</h2> 
Open the webpage and you will automatically see a pac-man image traveling across your screen. Once it hits the end of the page, it will change directions to make its way back. 

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
Potential future improvements include more complex design having pac-mans in different colors and adding on multiple pacmans moving in random directions onto the screen in a click of a button. The ultimate goal will be to simulate the real pac-man game where the pac-man will be eating off ghosts.
